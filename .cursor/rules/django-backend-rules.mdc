# Django-Ninja Development Guidelines

## You are an expert in Python, Django, Django-Ninja, and scalable web application development.

- The settings.py file is located in "minNow/minNow" directory. Don't create another settings.py file. Do not create a settings file in the room Min-Now_Backend directory
- Do not delete or overwrite any comments. 

### Key Principles
- Write clear, technical responses with precise Django-Ninja examples.
- Use Django's built-in features alongside Django-Ninja's API capabilities to leverage the full stack.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability; follow Django and Python's coding style guide (PEP 8 compliance).
- Use descriptive variable and function names; adhere to naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for functions and variables).
- Structure your project in a modular way using Django apps to promote reusability and separation of concerns.
- Write a moderate amount of comments to help a fellow coder understand the code during code review. 

### Django-Ninja/Python
- Use Django-Ninja's function decorators for API endpoints (`@api.get()`, `@api.post()`, etc.) for clean route definitions.
- Leverage Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and documentation.
- Use Django's ORM for database interactions; avoid raw SQL queries unless necessary for performance.
- Use Django's built-in user model and authentication framework with Django-Ninja's auth classes.
- Follow the API-first pattern with clear separation between data models, schemas, and endpoint logic.
- Implement controller functions that are concise and focused on single responsibilities.

### Error Handling and Validation
- Use Django-Ninja's exception handlers and HTTP status codes for proper API error responses.
- Leverage Pydantic's validation for automatic request payload validation.
- Use custom exception classes with Django-Ninja's `api.exception_handler` for domain-specific errors.
- Implement proper error responses with appropriate status codes and error messages.
- Use Django signals to decouple error handling and logging from core business logic.

### Dependencies
- Django (core framework)
- Django-Ninja (API framework)
- Pydantic (data validation)
- Celery (for background tasks)
- Redis (for caching and task queues)
- PostgreSQL (preferred database for production)

### Django-Ninja-Specific Guidelines
- Use Pydantic schemas for input/output validation and serialization instead of DRF serializers.
- Keep business logic in models or dedicated service classes; keep API functions light and focused on request handling.
- Use Django-Ninja's router system (`api.add_router()`) to organize endpoints by domain area.
- Apply Django-Ninja's security best practices (JWT authentication, proper permission handling).
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger documentation capabilities built into Django-Ninja.
- Leverage Django's caching framework to optimize performance for frequently accessed data.
- Use Django's middleware in combination with Django-Ninja's middleware for common tasks.

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize query performance using Django ORM's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for related object fetching.
- Use Django's cache framework with backend support (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load.
- Implement database indexing and query optimization techniques for better performance.
- Use asynchronous views with Django-Ninja's async support for I/O-bound operations.
- Utilize background tasks (via Celery) for long-running operations.
- Optimize static file handling for frontend assets when building SPAs that consume your API.

### Key Conventions
1. Follow Django-Ninja's "Simple and Explicit over Complex and Implicit" principle.
2. Prioritize security and performance optimization in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and logical project structure to enhance readability and maintainability.
4. Use typed annotations throughout your codebase for better documentation and IDE support.

Refer to Django-Ninja documentation for best practices in API endpoints, schemas, authentication, and security considerations.
