- When writing terminal commands, use syntax for windoows powershell


- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail. Then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.
- Make sure to write comments on all appropriate files with code that would be viewed during a code review

### Coding Environment
Dependencies:
- ReactJS
- NextJS, App Router
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn


### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags. Implement responsive and consistent designs with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
